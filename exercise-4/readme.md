## Exercise #4
#### `TODO` create a class to count search results

***start with:***
- all the stuff from before, with some modifications
- an empty movie-search.js (your future class!)

***end with:***
- the same visual results as before, plus a counter!

---



### Rough process:

1. notice the changes to the index.html file; we've added a DOM element for our counter
2. notice the changes to our template.js file; we've added a render() function that does looping for us
3. notice the constructor for movie-search.js; it takes the omdb api as a parameter!
4. implement the functions in movie-search.js
5. use movie-search.js in a new index.js function that performs the search lookup (replacing the old function)
6. implement the updateCounter() function and other details to make the counter work
